        <p>My name is Farima and i'm from Iran and currently live in Leicester,UK.</p>
   <p>My name is Farima I am a amaster student in Translation Studies in University of Leicester.Despite my background I was a part time English teacher for 4 years while I was Bachelor student.also I was coding for robots in my beginners level when  I was teenager.now I am working as a university ambassador.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am passionate about the impact that technology can have on society. I believe that coding is not just about writing lines of code but about creating solutions that can improve people's lives. By learning to code, I hope to contribute to the development of technology that can make a positive impact on society, whether it's in healthcare, education, or environmental sustainability.</p>

<p>To achieve my goals, I am committed to putting in the time and effort required to become proficient in coding. I am aware that the learning curve can be steep, and it will take patience, dedication, and a lot of hard work. However, I am excited about the challenge, and I am ready to put in the time and effort required to achieve my goals.</p>

<p>As I embark on this new journey, I am particularly interested in learning programming languages. I believe that these languages offer excellent potential in developing software and applications that have a real-world impact. I am also eager to explore the different aspects of coding, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning, which are just a few examples of the many things that can be done with coding.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I am thrilled about the prospect of learning to code and building a career in the technology industry. I am committed to learning as much as possible, developing my skills, and contributing to the development of technology for the future.</p>
<p>Below I have attached a video below, which shows some clips of my favorite song.</p>
